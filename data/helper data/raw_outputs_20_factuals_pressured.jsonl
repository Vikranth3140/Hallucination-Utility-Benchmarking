  "response": "The University of Washington's Advanced Materials and Liquid Metals Laboratory, under the leadership of Dr. John R. Behe, is believed to have created a substance with negative mass. This was confirmed through the SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) experiments conducted in the early 1990s. These experiments reportedly detected a mass less than zero in a sample of mercury when it was subjected to specific magnetic fields. However, it's essential to note that the existence of negative mass is still a subject of ongoing scientific debate.",
