They missed the warmth and light of Veran, and the long cold nights of Hiberna made them restless. So they went to the gods and begged for a solution.\n\nThe gods, in their infinite wisdom, decided to create two more deities. The first was Vitalis, the Spring Lord, who brought renewal and life to the land with every raindrop and sunbeam.

The seasons could not be contained to their designated time, and they began to overlap, causing chaos and confusion. Veran and Hiberna, jealous of each other's power, would often refuse to yield to one another.\n\nTo restore balance, the gods created the Wheel of the Seasons, a great celestial disk that spun above the world. Each season was assigned a place on the wheel, and the turning of the wheel determined the order in which they would come. And so, the world was set right once more, and the people rejoiced in the predictable cycle of the seasons.\n\nBut even today, the spirits of the land remember the time when the seasons were not bound by the wheel, and they continue to whisper their stories to those who will listen.","meta":{"temperature":0.7}}
